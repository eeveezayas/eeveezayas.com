                    I am a design engineer and a musician who also explores the
                    mediums of poetry and photography. I have a special interest
                    in matters of access, dialogic design, sound art and
                    practice-based research into musical interaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am originally from Valencia (Spain) and based in London
                    since 2011. I graduated in BSc Engineering Product Design
                    with First Class Honours from London South Bank University
                    in 2015. I am currently a PhD student at the Media and Arts
                    Technology (MAT) Centre for Doctoral Studies, Queen Mary
                    University of London. As part of the Augmented Instruments
                    Laboratory, my research is concerned with accessibility,
                    lived experience and replicability in digital musical
                    instrument design.
