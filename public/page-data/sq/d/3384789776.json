While the instrument could be used to sonify any data, for this project we have specifically worked with satellite data from the ESA and SNSA API to provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between the 3 cities we are from across the seasons, and also to compare two different environments. Data is presented on laser-cut images that abstract the data, presenting as a cross between a piece of art and a cartridge for a games console.","credits":"This project was a collaboration between Gawain Hewitt, Sabina Barcucci, Johnnie Hård, Eevee Zayas and Malin Arvidsson.

Instead of being connected to catheters, the end of the giving sets are aligned using laser-cut acrylic arms. These are directly above a plate which holds four strips of brass. Under each piece of metal is a piezo transducer which is connected to Bela. This computer is running a compiled Pure Data patch which uses the excitation of the piezos to generate a random with each drop. Each number corresponds to a different note in a preset chord. By using the potentiometers on the breadboard, the user can change the base pitch, the envelope or the chord.","achievements":"Exhibited at Tate Modern (Hackoustic Tate Lates), London Roundhouse (Rising, We Are Now, Chairman's Dinner), Funkhaus (MTF Berlin), Old Truman Brewery (We Are Robots) and LimeWharf (Hackoustic)."}},{"node":{"title":"Kazumi","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"srcSet":"/static/3bf5be9064c9d30e173e10f387a496ca/f836f/kazumi.jpg 200w,\n/static/3bf5be9064c9d30e173e10f387a496ca/2244e/kazumi.jpg 400w,\n/static/3bf5be9064c9d30e173e10f387a496ca/14b42/kazumi.jpg 800w,\n/static/3bf5be9064c9d30e173e10f387a496ca/10d63/kazumi.jpg 1080w"}}},"alt":"Hands playing on the first working prototype of Kazumi, a gray seven sided truncated pyramid","caption":"First version of Kazumi, developed at LSBU and Makerversity in 2015","description":"<a href='https://www.coroflot.com/luiszayas/Kazumi' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Kazumi</a> is an accessible instrument for aspiring musicians and makers. It is a completely new interface that is designed to be engaging for anyone that is interested in making music. Its design has been subject to many different constraints in order to remove as many barriers to participation as possible. Each of the seven surfaces is a touch-pad that is subdivided into five configurable electrodes. The structure can be rotated on its base to transpose the selected scale. Playing music on Kazumi is a tactile, sensual experience, hands exploring and caressing to draw different notes from the speaker embedded in the peak. It has been designed as an open-source DIY kit. This will not only allow anyone to learn about the materials and processes that have gone into the instrument but it will empower users by encouraging them to hack and customise it as the ultimate way of appropriation.","credits":"Kazumi was developed by Eevee Zayas-Garin during their undergraduate studies at London South Bank University and a residency at Makerversity.","achievements":"Winner of the Drake Music Accessible Music Tech 2016 Hackathon at Queen Mary University of London.
